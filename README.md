```
# Code
We provide scripts for reproducing results from our paper. You can train our model from scratch, or use our weights to process your images.
# Quickstart (Demo)
You can test our super-resolution algorithm with your images. Place your images in ``test/input`` folder.
Or if you want to bokeh the images in any folder, please change the folder path on ``line 35 of test.py`` to the location you want.
